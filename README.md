# DSGC-AIO-Patch

#### By DSG Cubik

Full Compatability Patch (v1.0)

Attempts to fill the gaps in compatability between the following mods:
	
	Modular Kolonization Systems
	(Basically the whole USI Constellation)
	OSE Workshop Reworked
	Kerbal Planetary Base Systems
	Extraplanetary Launchpads
	... Possibly More
	
	I will attempt to balance the resources between the different construction methods but cannot promise anything.

## Important Info
	
	-DOES NOT- do anything until the required mods are installed, and can be used without the entire collection of mods installed
	
	-Tested on KSP Version 1.12.9-
	
	Mod Dependencies = None (but does not take away the dependencies for other respective mods)
	
	Can optionally be controlled by Patch Manager if installed
	
	Only a few items aren't on the list yet, sorry theres alot I'm still working on finishing it
	
	During testing OSE does not consider B9 Part Switch as a dependency but the tanks don't work without it

## Mods Affected
	
	Modular Kolonization Systems
	Kerbal Planetary Base Systems
	Extraplanetary Launchpads
	OSE Workshop Reworked
	B9 Part Switch

## Installation
	
	Just drop the folder DSGC into KerbalSpaceProgram/GameData and everything should be taken care of.
